Dig for gold outside your territory (in the wilderness). However, due to the risk of player kills, we recommend using an <strong>invisibility potion</strong>. </p><h4>⛏️ How to Dig for Gold (Details)</h4><p><strong>Things You'll Need:</strong></p><ul><li>Efficiency V, Durability III Pickaxe and Shovel</li><li>Food</li><li><strong>Potion of Invisibility</strong> (for safety)</li><li>Haste II Potion</li></ul><p><strong>How to Dig:</strong></p><ol><li>Go outside your territory (in the wilderness). </li><li><strong>Drink a Potion of Invisibility</strong> (to prevent PK). </li><li>Dig down to the recommended depth (around y12 or y22). </li><li>Use a mining potion to dig efficiently (e.g., 5 blocks wide x 2 blocks high). </li></ol><h3>② Business (Shop Management)</h3><p>Earn money by opening your own shop or selling items to buy-back shops like Mali or Yamato. </p><h3>③ PK (Player Kill)</h3><p>This method involves killing other players and stealing their items.
